# Clean-Class-Craftinh-ranim
A dedicated repository for practicing Java class design and OOP principles, focusing on building scalable and organized code structures.
# 🏗️ Java OOP Blueprints

This repository is my dedicated space for mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Here, I focus on the "Art of the Class"—designing structured, reusable, and efficient code architectures.

##  Learning Objectives
In this repository, I document my progress in shifting from functional scripts to full-scale object-oriented design. My focus areas include:
* **Class Architecture:** Designing robust and logical class structures.
* **Encapsulation:** Managing data access and protecting object integrity.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Building scalable hierarchies and flexible code.
* **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems through interfaces and abstract classes.

##  Repository Roadmap
Each directory represents a specific milestone in my learning journey:
* `/Foundations`: Basic class definitions and constructors.
* `/Relationships`: Practicing Composition and Aggregation between objects.
* `/Advanced-Concepts`: Exploring Abstract classes, Interfaces, and Method Overriding.

##  Why this matters
I believe that writing code that "works" is easy, but writing code that is "well-organized" is a craft. This repository showcases my commitment to becoming a software architect who values **Clean Code** and **Maintainability**.
